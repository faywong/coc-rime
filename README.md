## Install

First you need to install my version of [`rime-cli`](https://github.com/tonyfettes/rime-cli).

You could clone the repo and `make` to get the binary file,
or, if you use Arch Linux, you could use the `PKGBUILD` here.

For now, the only to install the plugin is to clone the repo and run `yarn`.

## Keymaps

No keymaps for now, maybe in the future we could let
user to turn of the source.

## Lists

No List support now, but in the future we will add it to
let user choose the input schema.
